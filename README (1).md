# This website will be for Cyber Response. A webstie where companies can discretely and #thoroughly report and search cyber security related issues. All reports will be tranfered into #the STIX/TAXII/CyBox framework. Companies will create accounts and be generated aliases to     #to allow for a more comfortable and secure place for them to report attacks, vulnerabilities,  #and patches. General users (people not organizations), can also create accounts and be #generated aliases. They can and attacks, vulnerabilites, and patches they experience. Every  
#user will have the ability to search for attacks, vulnerabilities or patches on the site to
#allow them to secure their own networks.
